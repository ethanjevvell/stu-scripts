Orbit Pathfinder Algorithm Proposal
----------------------------------

1. We find the plane that intersects the launch point, target point and planet center. This plane must contain the optimal orbit path.
2. We can then generate a set of points on the plane a set distance from the planet center. These points are on the orbit path.
3. The first point the rocket traverses is directly above the launch site. This point is always the first point on the orbit path.
4. There are then two directions we could go; one is optimal, the other is the long way around.
5. To determine the optimal path, we first find which orbit point is closest to the target point.
6. We then traverse the set of orbit points in each direction, starting from the first point, until we reach the point closest to the target point.
	NOTE: This can probably be done as follows:
	EX: Points = [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O]
		i. Create a second list of points where the first point is the same, but the rest of the points are in reverse order.
			EX: Points2 = [A, O, N, M, L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B]
		ii. Traverse each until one of them reaches the target point.
		iii. The path that reaches the target point first is the optimal path, so we can return a slice 
			 of that path from 0 to the index of the target point.
7. All LIGMA has to do then is traverse each point in order, followed by a terminal phase.
